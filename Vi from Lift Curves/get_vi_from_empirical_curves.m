    % You can make the following function call with show_details = 1 for
    % all outputs, plots, etc. Conversely if you're only interested in the resulting
    % delta thrust at a certain rpm, Va(airspeed), and angle of attack, 
    % set show_details = 0

end

% This function can be used to derive coefficients for induced lift and
% incuded velocity (vi), and will plot the resulting fucntions (show_details = 1)
% The Lift fucntion is per unit speed (in m/s) for the incident airstream
% The Vi function is per unit speed (in m/s), per unit angle (in rads)
% See notes on use below:

    % current code impl. uses a single coeff for 'lift' and 'vi' (try simplified_coeff = 1)
    % lift_estimate = lift_coeff*Va;
    % vi_estimate = vi_coeff*Va*AOA;
    
    % A more precise 2-coeff solution for 'lift' and 'vi' can also be derived here
    % (try simplified_coeff = 0) (this is now rpm dependent)
    % lift_estimate = [lift_coeff(1)*rpm + lift_coeff(0)]*Va;
    % vi_estimate = [vi_coeff(1)*rpm + vi_coeff(0)]*Va*AOA;
 
% The actual output of the function is simply the resulting delta_thrust 
% at the rpm, airspeed, and aoa provided in the function call
% (if you need to do this a lot, you're better off outputting the coeffs
% for lift and vi and making a separate function)

    % This test data was generated with an incident airstream of ~9 m/s on
    % our thrust jig. The resulting polyfits from an RPM sweep of
    % 2000-6000 are found below. Obviously with only one airspeed we are
    % limited in how accurate this can be for the moment.
